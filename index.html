<p>Text Fighter is a text-based RPG game. It's still in early development (Alpha stage), so there may be a lot of bugs/missing features. There isn't really any set goal or missions yet, but there's still a lot of things you can do. Fight a variety of enemies to get coins, gain xp, and unlock achievements. You can spend money on more weapons/supplies, and unlock items by leveling up. There's even a casino where you can gamble your hard-earned coins. If you aren't one who likes playing by the rules, you can use the built in cheats to your advantage (or disadvantage). More in-depth documentation/information is available via the in-game help menus.</p>

<p>This is my first (And currently only "big") Java project, so this is meant as a learning experience for me. I've been lightly developing this over the past couple of years while I learn Java. </p>

<h2>
<a id="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h2>

<p>First, make sure you have the latest version of <a href="https://www.java.com">Java</a> installed on your computer. Download the jar file from the latest <a href="https://github.com/hhaslam11/Text-Fighter/releases">release</a>. 
Simply clicking on the .jar file won't work (..yet). You need to run it in the command line.
Open your command line/terminal, navigate to the downloaded .jar and run <code>java -jar Text.Fighter.jar</code>. If you want to run Text Fighter without the splash screen and popups (No GUI; true text-based), simply run it with the <code>nogui</code> option: <code>java -jar Text.Fighter.jar nogui</code>.
<em>Text-fighter should work on Windows, Mac, and Linux.</em> </p>

<h2>
<a id="modifications" class="anchor" href="#modifications" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Modifications</h2>

<p>I've made it easy to add your own weapons/enemy types into the game via modifying the code. With just a couple lines of code, you can fully implement a new weapon or enemy with your own properties. This will automatically setup achievements, and even create a full information page in the help menu for your modification. Instruction on how to do this can be found commented in-line at the bottom of <a href="https://github.com/hhaslam11/Text-Fighter/blob/master/src/com/hotmail/kalebmarc/textfighter/main/Start.java">Start.java</a>
 Feel free to fork your own copy, add your own enemies/weapons and then send a pull-request for me to add it to the code.</p>

<h2>
<a id="documentation" class="anchor" href="#documentation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Documentation</h2>

<p>Pretty much all the information you need about the game mechanics is available in-game via the help menus (Accessible through the <em>home</em> menu). I'll add all necessary information to the <a href="https://github.com/hhaslam11/Text-Fighter/wiki">wiki</a> at a later date. I'm not sure if I will add documentation about the code itself yet, that will be determined at a later time.</p>

<h2>
<a id="upcoming" class="anchor" href="#upcoming" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Upcoming</h2>

<p>I'm planning to continue developing Text Fighter for a while, as it's proven to be a good resource to help teach me Java. I don't have an end-goal for the project, but I do have a lot of things I want to eventually add. Everything I plan for Text Fighter is posted in <a href="https://github.com/hhaslam11/Text-Fighter/issues">issues.</a></p>

<p>In the beta stage, I want to add a better UI while still keeping the game mostly text-based. For example, having buttons to click on instead of typing numbers in, but still having the output be in text form.</p>

<p><em>If you want to request any feature, open an <a href="https://github.com/hhaslam11/Text-Fighter/issues">issue</a>, and there's a good chance I'll add it.</em></p>
